# Street Fighter Game (Title TBA)

Sami:
Hey guys, I've essentially written the intro to the game now and a basic object file/header for Character.
There's also a new function cpp file for selecting the correct character, but the terminal freaks out if you enter a letter or character instead - if anyone can fix that up quickly that would be sweet!

I also wrote a function that is used at the beginning of the game to create a random array which will dictate the order which the opponenets are versed in. Each element of this array is a number from 1-4 and will be the ID of the other characters that you don't select (the User character ID will be 0).
