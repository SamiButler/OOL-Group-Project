Major Practical Design


Project Description
Class Character will contain the name, health points and other variables relating to the character. This class will act as a parent class to the move class which will contain the information for each move.


Classes


class Character
{
public:
        character();
        string name;
        int hitpoints;
        static int stun_counter;
        choose_character();
        set_character_ID();
                character_ID = floor(rand)*5 + 1;
        find_matchup();
        {
                Next_opponent.character_ID == 1 // This definitely is not the right code at this 
        // stage, but it gets the idea across.
}


Private:
        int character_ID;
        int* ID_array[4];
        Int used_IDs[4];
        Int ID_counter;
};




class Move         //Parent class for all attack classes.
{
Public:
        Int heavy_recharge_time;
        Int special_recharge_time;
        
};


class Light_Attack : public Move
{


};




class Heavy_Attack : public Move
{


};




class Defend : public Move
{


};


class Special_Attack : public Move
{


};

WEEKLY PLANNING


Week 10: Create the code for each of the classes, and ensure that there are no issues with any of their designs, as well as a basic round structure code. (two people on classes,  on round structure).


Week 11: Integrate the classes into the gameplay system.Test how effectively the round gameplay works, and whether each move type and player matchup works as intended. (divide matchups between group members.)


TESTING STRATEGY
Most of the testing we plan to implement will be unit testing, which is evident in the design of our makefile, which is structured by each smaller component of the system. In earlier testing, we will focus on the individual components of the system, and then move into a more integration testing method to see how the elements work as a whole system.

How the game works:


You begin by choosing a character out of:


1. Scott Pilgrim (snitch)
2. Tony Montana (thug)
3. Skinny Pete (skinny)
4. Dirty Harry (cop)
5. Chuck Norris (all-rounder)


You then play 4 rounds facing off against the other 4 characters and if you pass all of these stages, you face the final boss (The Godfather). If you defeat the final boss, you win the game and are the king of the streets.
